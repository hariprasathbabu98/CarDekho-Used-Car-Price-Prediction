ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è How we are going to predict the car price ? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Collect the data of Car Details, Car Overview, Car Features, Car Specifications for each and every car. As we know that Kilo meter driven can be the important independent variable to predict the price. In the same way, year of manufacturing, features and specifications makes considerable impact in the car price.
